# ecPerson

This is a small and easy to use application for managing addresses.
You can create an address management file in any directory. In this file, you can store the necessary contact details for each person (e.g. the project team).
This programme is designed to manage a small, limited number of addresses.
It stores the addresses in a SQLite database.
